But we have not talked about the physical size of computers in the homelab.\nThis can be a bit of a touchy subject, as the form factor of your computer is large dictated by the era you bought your computer, how powerful it is, and even its architecture.\nLets start with a history lesson, shall we?\nThe early 2000s of home computing # Life was simple, You AOL\u0026rsquo;d your dial up with your netscape on yahoo. I think.\nIn this age, Homelabbing was running your own ISP, BBS, or simple web server with maybe another desktop tower.\nThe 2015 era of home computing # Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/10e7dry/my_new_server_rack/\nEbay flows with surplus hardware, power is cheap, your wallet is thin, but the soul is willing. You just finished your ESXI Vmug purchase, and nothing can stop you and your 42U rack from computing perfection. Your life is ran by one standard, Rack units.\nWhat even is a rack unit? # A rack unit is the height of a computer in a server rack, it is 1.75 inches, which is a bit thin.\nMost devices in a server rack tend to be above 1u except for dedicated compute, or network switches, 2u is the minimum, 4u being the most common size for servers, both DIY and industrial\nThe mid 2020s of home computing # Holy COFLATION Batman!\nPower cost has gone up, Raspi has died, and the mini-x86 revolution is in full swing!\nWe are trying to hold onto the glory of the 19in rack, but with some issues.\nMost of the rackmount gear is made for intel nucs, a somewhat dying platform, and that gear is all over 50 USD, this still does not solve power density, or form how the ports on intel nucs are all over the place.\nWhat standards already exist for small device mounting? # There are a few preexisting sub computer mounting standards, surely we don\u0026rsquo;t need to make another standard, right?\nDIN Rails # These are used in industrial settings, and are a bit of a pain to use, while the din rail itself is cheap, the actual computers and power supplies for this are expensive. This also limits you to small devices like SOCs and dedicated industrial computers.\nBlade servers # Blade servers are typically vendor locked in vendor specific chassis, and are not very common in the homelab space, as they are expensive and power hungry, and have no interchangeability.\nOpen19\u0026rsquo;s Bricks # If you remember from my first HomeCompute, I mentioned Open19, and their bricks. I think this has some merit, but the actual execution of this is difficult to execute in the home, due to their specialized dense cables.\nIt might be time to ditch the 19in rack. # A 19in rack only gives you about 17.5in or useable space for internal width, 17.5 x 3.5in x 25in is not optimized for your home space, you either have to sacrifice in additional upward Us, or a deeper rack. At that point, you wont be able to reach the back of your rack easily, and most of your space will be wasted.\nIf only there was some shape that is common and cheap enough for us to use and work with on a normal basis\u0026hellip;\nThe KubeLab # While preparing to move for what seems to be the 3rd failed time.

Your welcome to grab your Kill-A-Watt but we will not be using it.\nLets grab our handy notebook. 📓 # Behold, the GRAPH\nAs small as it looks. This is our master plan.

I am using a 1000w server power supply, but you could also use ATX power supplies, cheap amazon power supplies, or anything else you can find.\nTo find if your power supply can handle the load, make sure it has the right wattage listed for your predicted max load.\nProblem 2: Distribution # There are two kinds of distribution problems we need to solve.\nProblem 2.1 End User # The end user, meaning your device, server, or branch networks, are going to have their own requirements on what voltage they are expecting.\nIf your end user voltage is different from your backhaul voltage. you will need to use either a buck or boost converter to adjust the voltage. I would recommend grouping these loads together to save parts.\nProblem 2.2 Backhaul # Keep the below in mind.\nWire size guide\nIn general, the higher your backhaul voltage, the smaller wires you can use for the same power, We will need this at its largest rating off of the power supply. But a way to reduce long large wires is to use a distribution box with fuses for your smaller branches.\nWe need the fuses to protect the wires during a fault. If we have a fault on underrated unfused wire. We have a 🔥 hazard. The wire will go hot, and melt.\nThis allows you to use more, but smaller wires, to power your loads. This is great for smaller setups, but not for large setups. 1000w at 12v is 90 amps, this requires large wires and fuses.\nProblem 3 Connectors # In short, Anderson powerpoles and xt30 are great for anything under 30 amps.

The idea behind both is that the current way of how server racks are defined tend to get disorganized when you install racks full of computers. These attempt to resolve power and density in their own ways.\nOpenCompute # What does OpenCompute bring to the table # Opencompute touches multiple aspects of the datacenter, but we are most interested in rack and power\nWhat does a server\u0026rsquo;s footprint look like? # Opencompute includes a definition that essentially means \u0026ldquo;it can fit in a 19 inch rack\u0026rdquo;, this is not much different from what we have now.\nWhat does power look like? # Opencompute uses a 48V bus bar, when fully installed, this 48v bus will feed the equipment via a connector on the back of the device, it is up to the equipment to regulate to its proper internal voltage. Power is fed from 1 or more \u0026ldquo;power shelves\u0026rdquo; which are dedicated devices with multiple load-sharing and redundant power supplies feedings them.\nWhat does networking look like? # OpenCompute does not refine physical network interfaces for ethernet or fiber.

If multiple servers are able to benefit from centralized redundancy. They can benefit from better quality power supplies as well.\nHigh voltages require smaller wires # Its true, the higher the volts, the lower the amps, 1000 Watts is either 84 Amps at 12V, or 20 amps at 48 volts, this goes from needing 3 AWG cables to 14 AWG cables. for reference, 3 AWG is what is used to feed your house\u0026rsquo;s electrical panel! 14 awg is similar to what you use to feed your normal wall plugs.

Meaning a bacteria/yeast that will consume sugar, then produce CO2 and good ol\u0026rsquo; alchohol (but in insignificant amounts in this case).\nWater Keifer is a specific combination of the bacteria and yeast. When given sugar water (or something akin to fruit juice). You end up with a somewhat yeasty tasting liquid that does not have the acidity that most would expect from a similar product called Kombucha. However, the fun comes with putting them into sealed bottles that can hold pressure, like those Kombucha bottles some of us may or may not have been collecting. You end up with a semi-sweet drink that is as fizzy as soda from a can.\nStrong start # I grabbed the dehydrated grains from the same place TheBruShow grabbed his. I attempted to rehydrate it, but was having issues with the actual fermentation until I used some rasins and raw cane sugar about 4 days later. The first actually fermented batches worked flawlessly, tasted great and has a roundtrip time of hours, instead of a week with my normal kombucha. I would leave the bottles on the table overnight, and they would fizz to cannon level pressures by morning. Time to start playing with special juices\u0026hellip;\nSickening Halt # Things started to go wrong with my attempt for a strange juice with Strawberry Banana Orange. I was already skeptical as it was not my first choice\u0026hellip; but figured it would be worth a shot.\nI mixed my grains with the sketch juice and raisins to keep the fast fermentation going. Little did I know something bad was going to start happening. The next day, there was a layer of dense foam on the top, not like a carbonation fizz, I decided to bottle it anyways, and prep the second batch with a juice combo I like with no rasins. I tested my sketch juice the next day, It tasted bad. I considered the banana to be the culprit and tossed my bottles, waiting for my current batch in the next 2 days.\nThe day after, on 2023-07-25. I tasted the new batch, my mouth was overtaken by what I could only describe as rot. It took every ounce of willpower to not hurl on the floor after spitting it out on the sink.\nAfter gathering my senses (and my stomach). I realized it was the same taste as the sketch juice x100, but none of those ingredients were present in this batch.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tossed my grains for now. I plan to grab a new set soon. I\u0026rsquo;ll be attempting to do a more pure set of grains. But I may just been unlucky.\nFinal thoughts # I had fun, not the first time I made something rotten. (Some day I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the fuzzy pickle incident.) But I would still recommend giving Water Keifer a try, do not try to use stupid juices like I did.

Where did all those come from?\nThese are known as \u0026ldquo;Dotfiles\u0026rdquo; They are files that contain information based on their names and the programs that use them. When you perpend a filename with a dot . it will be hidden from plain view. Similar if you did the same with a $ in Windows.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve currently been on a crusade to manage my dotfiles, I want to have my dotfiles versioned, easy to install, and require minimal amount of special tools. My reasoning is the following\u0026hellip;\nVersioning means I can roll back my changes if I bork a config and do not know where exactly why I have made a change. (git blame is a good tool for that if you practice verbose commits)\nEasy to install means these to me.\nI can easily select which tools I want to install. I can do so in as few lines as possible I do not require any special tools. This leads us to some special tools that I have chosen. Git and Stow. But why? There are many dotfile managers out.\nGit and Stow are common tools used out in the wild git and stow are either older or extremely popular programs, It would be hard to find a system that did not include it in their package managers. (Even Alpine, a distribution known for its small footprint, has git and stow in its repos. Git are Stow are easy to use programs. Git and stow require minimal configuration to get started. Git can clone repos without credentials or setup (Unless you use a private repo). Stow doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a configuration file, but the directory tree of the folders underneath it to determine what to do. Git allows for git within git. Known as git submodules This was originally for projects that would use other repositories within their own projects. It allows you to keep a directory within your git repo to actually represent a different repo all together, On the working dir they look identical, but in Git they are represented by different types of pointers. You may want to keep different aspects of your dotfiles separate from your main repo. Or use someone elses Dotfiles as a reference (Such as themes for i3, Awesome, etc). So, You decided to Git your dotfiles\u0026hellip; What next? # Read your manpages I\u0026rsquo;m not joking. For everything you want to dotfile, check your manpages. Why? Programs will often check 3 locations for configs.\nA system location. A .config location. Your home dir. For example. Lets reference i3\u0026rsquo;s Manpage\nWhen starting, i3 looks for configuration files in the following order: 1. ~/.config/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config if set) 2. /etc/xdg/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3/config if set) 3. ~/.i3/config 4. /etc/i3/config You can specify a custom path using the -c option. That\u0026rsquo;s right, i3 has 4 locations it checks by default without options. 3 of them in your home directory, one of them being a system shared directory.\nSo\u0026hellip; since we are version managing and symlinking all our dotfiles anyways, We can have some fun with putting our files in locations that will not clutter our base homedir, yet findable without special configuration.\nHow to use Stow # Stow it away! # Stow original usecase is long gone. It has been replaced by package managers. How it use to manage those issues is what will benefit us.\nWhat stow does, is take a folder from the working dir. Then apply to the directory above it a collection of syslinks matching the pattern of the folder below it.\nNow that\u0026rsquo;s a garbage description. Lets see the manpage.\nstow - manage farms of symbolic links That\u0026rsquo;s even worse\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do an example\nThis is my test dir before running stow.\n/home/blackphidora/notmyhome/ └── stowsdir ├── bash │ └── .bash_profile ├── i3 │ └── .config │ └── i3 └── zfs └── .config └── somezfs 8 directories, 1 file Lets try doing cd stowsdir \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stow *.\n/home/blackphidora/notmyhome/ ├── .bash_profile -\u0026gt; stowsdir/bash/.bash_profile ├── .config │ ├── i3 -\u0026gt; ../stowsdir/i3/.config/i3 │ └── somezfs -\u0026gt; ../stowsdir/zfs/.config/somezfs └── stowsdir ├── bash │ └── .bash_profile ├── i3 │ └── .config │ └── i3 └── zfs └── .config └── somezfs 11 directories, 2 files Did you catch on yet? Yeah, It creates syslinks from the top down based on the folder stow references.\nWe can use this separate concerns for different applications. Such as Bash an i3.\nLets smash Git into it. # Git it? # Now that we have all of our files in a single folder. We can now manage it with git easily.\ngit init stowsdir\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go to much into git, There are better git tutorials out there than what I have. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t used git, Learn the following.\ngit commit git clone git submodule git commit git add Once you have your dotfiles in a repository. All you need to do is run the following,\nsudo dnf install git stow -y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://\u0026lt;yourgitrepo\u0026gt; .dotfiles \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd dotfiles \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stow * You may need to remove the original .bashrc in your home dir.\nGit Submodules # Yo Dawg. # I use git submodules to include a reference to liquidprompt\u0026rsquo;s repo in my dotfiles, This is the exception to my quote \u0026ldquo;Stow\u0026rsquo;s old use case is long gone\u0026rdquo;.\n/home/blackphidora/.dotfiles/liquidprompt └── .config ├── liquidprompt │ ├── liquidpromptrc │ ├── liquid.ps1 │ └── liquid.theme └── liquidpromptrc -\u0026gt; liquidprompt/liquidpromptrc /home/blackphidora/.dotfiles/liquidpromptprogram └── .bin └── liquidprompt ├── CHANGES ├── contrib │ ├── dist │ │ ├── archlinux-aur │ │ │ ├── liquidprompt.install │ │ │ └── PKGBUILD │ │ └── debian │ │ ├── create_deb.sh │ │ └── liquidprompt │ │ └── DEBIAN │ │ └── control │ └── README ├── CONTRIBUTING.md ├── demo.png ├── example.bashrc ├── .git ├── .github │ └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md ├── LICENSE ├── liquidprompt ├── liquidprompt.plugin.zsh ├── liquidpromptrc-dist ├── liquid.ps1 ├── liquid.theme ├── .mailmap ├── pmset-simulator ├── README.md └── test.sh 11 directories, 25 files If you would like to add a submodule to your repo.

It was fantastic to meet @Ell_o_Punk @ChrisLAS and @TheMaxamillion! Happy to be part of an enthusiastic community!\n\u0026mdash; Ryan W. W. (@Rwaltrtech) May 31, 2019 Majority of attendees seemed to be either individuals that work with linux most of the time in their day jobs, or hobbyists, not entirely surprising. Among those who worked with linux day to day, the word of the day was cloud.\nYeah, I know. THAT cloud.\n\u0026ldquo;When my company was bought, Even though we had fully paid off gear to manage our workload. We were instructed to migrate to AWS and then proceeded to toss out our on-premise gear after months of no use.\u0026rdquo;\nA Handsome TXLF Attendee \u0026ldquo;Sysadmin Jobs are declining, Cloud Engineer jobs are skyrocketing!\u0026rdquo;\nThomas Cameron durning the TXLF Keynote. The Talks # Most of the talks assumed beginner knowledge of Linux, which is great for me, a long time Linux professional and hobbyist. However I brought along two friends\u0026hellip;\nOne who was a Linux beginner, A fellow coworker on my support team. Lets call him Tux One with zero linux experience and is not technical, My dear girlfriend who is a theater and drama nut, but interested in learning. - Lets call her Jane Day 1 # The start of the Linuxing # Ansible Beginner to Brilliant # Going from @ansible basics to brilliance at the first session of the first day @texaslinuxfest pic.twitter.com/ltH6htGmVx\n\u0026mdash; Chris Fisher (@ChrisLAS) May 31, 2019 One of the first talks of the day 1, and the first one Jane and myself attended, and the first one that I realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t have my laptop\nThis talk assumed zero knowledge of Ansible, which is great I thought. The first half covered topics I already knew. But unfortunately I had to leave the talk midway though, Otherwise it was a great and knowledge talk that catered to a lot of people.\nI counted 67 people!!\n\u0026mdash; Ell -Going to Bsides San Antonio! (@Ell_o_Punk) May 31, 2019 Becoming Dangerous with Kubernetes # \u0026ldquo;It can\u0026rsquo;t be that easy\u0026hellip; is it?\u0026rdquo; # JJ\u0026rsquo;s introduction to Kubernetes is fantastic. # In more words, JJ is able to keep the audience engaged with his \u0026ldquo;frank to-the-point\u0026rdquo; humor.\nHis talk went into details about each component of K8s, Such as services, pods, and how pods are scheduled and managed between each other.\nAfter the talk, it left Tux and I surprised on how much about K8s we already knew, and that we assumed we knew less than we already knew.\nDay 2 # sudo dnf install caffeine # Linux Permissions 101 # chmod 777 # A rather basic introduction course, great for any linux beginner like my friend Tux.\nConfessions of a Sysadmin # \u0026ldquo;Its okay to be new.\u0026rdquo; # Been waiting for this! I know how hard @Ell_o_Punk worked on this talk. And how personal it is for both of them. She’s packed another room! pic.twitter.com/i9aQNH4twc\n\u0026mdash; Chris Fisher (@ChrisLAS) June 1, 2019 This is not a technical talk, it was a talk that wraps Ell and Allie\u0026rsquo;s Story into their IT careers, which is full of mishaps, potential fires and common tropes in the Linux Community. I originally wrote this off as a fun meta talk taking a break from the deep technical content of the other talks.\nTo my surprise, Tux and Jane benefited from the talk perhaps more than any other talks. Jane mentioned that she now understood that it was \u0026ldquo;okay to be wrong and to ask questions\u0026rdquo; about technology, I guess sometimes you just need to hear it from someone else to know that you are not going nuts.\nLinux Performance Tuning # iostat, ss, netstat and tuneD oh my # I learned the most at this talk, it is a shame that it is only 45 minutes long, easily could of been a 3 hour workshop. Thomas is a excellent speaker and I would recommend any of his talks or presentations.\nUnderstanding Containers # chroot /dankmemes/ # Ell goes into the deep history of Linux containers, Along with some tasks you can perform at home to create your own containers without using container tools. Such as how to copy every library you need to create an apache container using default linux tools.\nAutomate Absolutely Everything # ansible-galaxy init hype # Adam\u0026rsquo;s lively talk goes into what ansible can automate. a great introduction course to those who have not heard of ansible.\nSo\u0026hellip; how was it? # TXLF is great, I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in TXLF 2020 RIP public events ","date":"2019-06-04","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/txlf2019/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Texas Linux Fest For The First Timer","type":"posts"},{"content":" This is a legacy post What is a Yubikey? # A Yubikey is a hardware cryptographic engine and secret key storage device that is designed at the hardware level to prevent (if not just uncapable) to export the secrets it contains.

I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on diverse projects, optimizing infrastructure and streamlining operations.\nEven outside my day job, I\u0026rsquo;m neck-deep in my favorite tools. I\u0026rsquo;m an avid open source and Linux enthusiast, constantly tinkering with the latest in the DevOps ecosystem. Kubernetes has captured my interest, and it single-handedly saved my homelab with its advanced automation.\nWhat else am I into? # I tend to rotate hobbies every 3 months or so. The only constant is Linux—everything else is fair game.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve looked at railroads and the locomotives that run on them, pigeons, the credit card game for personal finance optimization, and I\u0026rsquo;m currently deep into Warhammer 40,000. I just started with the tabletop hobby, and I\u0026rsquo;m already dealing with the endless painting backlog everyone warned me about. There\u0026rsquo;s something about the grim darkness of the far future that pairs surprisingly well with debugging Kubernetes clusters.\n3D printing has also grabbed my attention (increasingly for terrain and hobby projects), and I\u0026rsquo;m always getting distracted by whatever shiny new thing catches my attention next.\nI also adopted a bloodhound named Roxy this year. She\u0026rsquo;s great at reminding me to take breaks from the screen.\nCommunity stuff # I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and learning from others. That\u0026rsquo;s why I actively participate in the K8s@Home Discord. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic platform where I can contribute my experiences, connect with like-minded individuals, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in Kubernetes and related technologies.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Connect! # I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my insights and experiences with you through this archive. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect. You can find me on the links on the homepage. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to drop me a message.
