Meaning a bacteria/yeast that will consume sugar, then produce CO2 and good ol\u0026rsquo; alchohol (but in insignificant amounts in this case).\nWater Keifer is a specific combination of the bacteria and yeast. When given sugar water (or something akin to fruit juice). You end up with a somewhat yeasty tasting liquid that does not have the acidity that most would expect from a similar product called Kombucha. However, the fun comes with putting them into sealed bottles that can hold pressure, like those Kombucha bottles some of us may or may not have been collecting. You end up with a semi-sweet drink that is as fizzy as soda from a can.\nStrong start # I grabbed the dehydrated grains from the same place TheBruShow grabbed his. I attempted to rehydrate it, but was having issues with the actual fermentation until I used some rasins and raw cane sugar about 4 days later. The first actually fermented batches worked flawlessly, tasted great and has a roundtrip time of hours, instead of a week with my normal kombucha. I would leave the bottles on the table overnight, and they would fizz to cannon level pressures by morning. Time to start playing with special juices\u0026hellip;\nSickening Halt # Things started to go wrong with my attempt for a strange juice with Strawberry Banana Orange. I was already skeptical as it was not my first choice\u0026hellip; but figured it would be worth a shot.\nI mixed my grains with the sketch juice and raisins to keep the fast fermentation going. Little did I know something bad was going to start happening. The next day, there was a layer of dense foam on the top, not like a carbonation fizz, I decided to bottle it anyways, and prep the second batch with a juice combo I like with no rasins. I tested my sketch juice the next day, It tasted bad. I considered the banana to be the culprit and tossed my bottles, waiting for my current batch in the next 2 days.\nThe day after, on 2023-07-25. I tasted the new batch, my mouth was overtaken by what I could only describe as rot. It took every ounce of willpower to not hurl on the floor after spitting it out on the sink.\nAfter gathering my senses (and my stomach). I realized it was the same taste as the sketch juice x100, but none of those ingredients were present in this batch.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tossed my grains for now. I plan to grab a new set soon. I\u0026rsquo;ll be attempting to do a more pure set of grains. But I may just been unlucky.\nFinal thoughts # I had fun, not the first time I made something rotten. (Some day I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the fuzzy pickle incident.) But I would still recommend giving Water Keifer a try, do not try to use stupid juices like I did. Stick to typical fruits.\nAttributions # https://www.flickr.com/photos/williamolyolson/ https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kombucha,_Synergy_Organic_bottles.jpg ","date":"2023-07-26","permalink":"/posts/water-keifer-what-went-wrong/","section":"Posts","summary":"Inspiration # First, I would like to thank TheBruShow To inspire me trying this out, Please take a watch if this sounds interesting to you","title":"Water Keifer: What went wrong?"},{"content":" This is a legacy post This did not age well.

Where did all those come from?\nThese are known as \u0026ldquo;Dotfiles\u0026rdquo; They are files that contain information based on their names and the programs that use them. When you perpend a filename with a dot . it will be hidden from plain view. Similar if you did the same with a $ in Windows.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve currently been on a crusade to manage my dotfiles, I want to have my dotfiles versioned, easy to install, and require minimal amount of special tools. My reasoning is the following\u0026hellip;\nVersioning means I can roll back my changes if I bork a config and do not know where exactly why I have made a change. (git blame is a good tool for that if you practice verbose commits)\nEasy to install means these to me.\nI can easily select which tools I want to install. I can do so in as few lines as possible I do not require any special tools. This leads us to some special tools that I have chosen. Git and Stow. But why? There are many dotfile managers out.\nGit and Stow are common tools used out in the wild git and stow are either older or extremely popular programs, It would be hard to find a system that did not include it in their package managers. (Even Alpine, a distribution known for its small footprint, has git and stow in its repos. Git are Stow are easy to use programs. Git and stow require minimal configuration to get started. Git can clone repos without credentials or setup (Unless you use a private repo). Stow doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a configuration file, but the directory tree of the folders underneath it to determine what to do. Git allows for git within git. Known as git submodules This was originally for projects that would use other repositories within their own projects. It allows you to keep a directory within your git repo to actually represent a different repo all together, On the working dir they look identical, but in Git they are represented by different types of pointers. You may want to keep different aspects of your dotfiles separate from your main repo. Or use someone elses Dotfiles as a reference (Such as themes for i3, Awesome, etc). So, You decided to Git your dotfiles\u0026hellip; What next? # Read your manpages I\u0026rsquo;m not joking. For everything you want to dotfile, check your manpages. Why? Programs will often check 3 locations for configs.\nA system location. A .config location. Your home dir. For example. Lets reference i3\u0026rsquo;s Manpage\nWhen starting, i3 looks for configuration files in the following order: 1. ~/.config/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config if set) 2. /etc/xdg/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3/config if set) 3. ~/.i3/config 4. /etc/i3/config You can specify a custom path using the -c option. That\u0026rsquo;s right, i3 has 4 locations it checks by default without options. 3 of them in your home directory, one of them being a system shared directory.\nSo\u0026hellip; since we are version managing and symlinking all our dotfiles anyways, We can have some fun with putting our files in locations that will not clutter our base homedir, yet findable without special configuration.\nHow to use Stow # Stow it away! # Stow original usecase is long gone. It has been replaced by package managers. How it use to manage those issues is what will benefit us.\nWhat stow does, is take a folder from the working dir. Then apply to the directory above it a collection of syslinks matching the pattern of the folder below it.\nNow that\u0026rsquo;s a garbage description. Lets see the manpage.\nstow - manage farms of symbolic links That\u0026rsquo;s even worse\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do an example\nThis is my test dir before running stow.\n/home/blackphidora/notmyhome/ └── stowsdir ├── bash │ └── .bash_profile ├── i3 │ └── .config │ └── i3 └── zfs └── .config └── somezfs 8 directories, 1 file Lets try doing cd stowsdir \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stow *.\n/home/blackphidora/notmyhome/ ├── .bash_profile -\u0026gt; stowsdir/bash/.bash_profile ├── .config │ ├── i3 -\u0026gt; ../stowsdir/i3/.config/i3 │ └── somezfs -\u0026gt; ../stowsdir/zfs/.config/somezfs └── stowsdir ├── bash │ └── .bash_profile ├── i3 │ └── .config │ └── i3 └── zfs └── .config └── somezfs 11 directories, 2 files Did you catch on yet? Yeah, It creates syslinks from the top down based on the folder stow references.\nWe can use this separate concerns for different applications. Such as Bash an i3.\nLets smash Git into it. # Git it? # Now that we have all of our files in a single folder. We can now manage it with git easily.\ngit init stowsdir\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go to much into git, There are better git tutorials out there than what I have. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t used git, Learn the following.\ngit commit git clone git submodule git commit git add Once you have your dotfiles in a repository.

I originally wrote this off as a fun meta talk taking a break from the deep technical content of the other talks.\nTo my surprise, Tux and Jane benefited from the talk perhaps more than any other talks.
