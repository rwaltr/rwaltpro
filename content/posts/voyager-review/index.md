# The newest of the new.
![The Voyager Keyboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/zsa-technology/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_scale,w_1854/v1/zsa-io-refactor-prod/@voyager/images/home/voyager-hero?_a=BATCvBOY0) 

> Who gave you the right to talk about this keyboard?

A few things, Actually.
- I suffer from hardcore RSI, making me sensitive to keyboards and hand movement.
  - Choc keyboards should help with this.
- I have been using the Moonlander for 4 years as my daily driver.
  - Games, Programming, you name it.
- Because My RSI is mostly based on my wrist moving too far from neutral, the less keys the better.
  - Home row mods are needed for this.
- My hands are *smol*.


## The Number of Keys.

I found that when using my moonlander, I did not use the inside edge at all. I did use the top, outer, and bottom edge, the voyager has the top, and outside edge. Seems reasonable.

I do wish I have some more keys by my thumb, but I am not sure the increase size is worth the extra buttons

## The Choc Experience

I normally use *MX Browns* for my recent keyboards, but on chocs, *browns* almost feel like linear, Recommend going clicky if this might bug you.

## Form factor

Even with aggressive tilting mods using the tripod mount. This keyboard achieves the same thing in a smaller, thinner, package.

## Price

High quality, low supply, niche market. The price is high, but it is not unreasonable for the target audience.

## Final word.

I enjoy it, and its solid
