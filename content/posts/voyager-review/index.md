> Who gave you the right to talk about this keyboard?

A few things, Actually.
- I suffer from hardcore RSI, making me sensitive to keyboards and hand movement.
  - Choc keyboards should help with this.
- I have been using the Moonlander for 4 years as my daily driver.
  - Games, Programming, you name it.
- Because My RSI is mostly based on my wrist moving too far from neutral, the less keys the better.
  - Home row mods are needed for this.
- My hands are *smol*.
