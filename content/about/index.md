Howdy! Welcome to the **Terminus**. My name is Ryan Walter, but you may know me better by my online handle, "*rwaltr*." I'm a passionate Site Reliability Engineer with a love for all things tech-related. From Linux and Kubernetes to electrical design and AI advancements, I'm constantly exploring and discovering the latest advancements in the tech world.

## Professional Background

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in various areas, including defining and executing policies and procedures, project management, and Kubernetes administration. As a Site Reliability Engineer, I thrive on the challenge of ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance of complex systems. I have worked on diverse projects, leveraging my expertise to optimize infrastructure and streamline operations.

## Hobbies and Interests

Even outside my day job, I am involved with some of my favorite tools. I'm an avid open source and Linux enthusiast, constantly tinkering with the latest in the *DevOps* ecosystem. Kubernetes has also captured my interest, and it was single-handly able to save running a *homelab* for me with its advance automation.

Beyond the digital realm, I have a passion for trains. There's something captivating about the raw power and elegance of these machines. I enjoy learning about their history, technology, and the impact they have had on society. It's always a thrill to visit train museums and witness these magnificent locomotives up close.

## Community Engagement

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and learning from others. That's why I actively participate in the [K8s@Home](https://discord.gg/kXU9DfGq) Discord. It's a fantastic platform where I can contribute my experiences, connect with like-minded individuals, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in Kubernetes and related technologies.

I'm excited to share my insights and experiences with you through this blog. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect.
