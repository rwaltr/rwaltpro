# Me 👈
Howdy! Welcome to **The Administratum Archives**. My name is Ryan Walter, but you probably know me as "*rwaltr*." 

### What do I do?

I'm a Kubernetes Engineer who spends way too much time thinking about GitOps, infrastructure automation, and why things break at 3 AM. 

Throughout my career, I've worked on defining policies, managing projects, and keeping complex systems from catching fire _(digitally speaking)_. I've worked on diverse projects, optimizing infrastructure and streamlining operations.

Even outside my day job, I'm neck-deep in my favorite tools. I'm an avid open source and Linux enthusiast, constantly tinkering with the latest in the *DevOps* ecosystem. Kubernetes has captured my interest, and it single-handedly saved my *homelab* with its advanced automation.

### What else am I into?

I tend to rotate hobbies every 3 months or so. The only constant is Linux—everything else is fair game.

I've looked at railroads and the locomotives that run on them, pigeons, the credit card game for personal finance optimization, and I'm currently deep into Warhammer 40,000. I just started with the tabletop hobby, and I'm already dealing with the endless painting backlog everyone warned me about. There's something about the grim darkness of the far future that pairs surprisingly well with debugging Kubernetes clusters.

3D printing has also grabbed my attention _(increasingly for terrain and hobby projects)_, and I'm always getting distracted by whatever shiny new thing catches my attention next.

I also adopted a bloodhound named Roxy this year. She's great at reminding me to take breaks from the screen.

### Community stuff

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and learning from others. That's why I actively participate in the [K8s@Home](https://discord.gg/kXU9DfGq) Discord. It's a fantastic platform where I can contribute my experiences, connect with like-minded individuals, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in Kubernetes and related technologies.

### Let's Connect!

I'm excited to share my insights and experiences with you through this archive. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect. You can find me on the links on the [homepage](/). Don't hesitate to drop me a message. I'm always eager to engage in meaningful discussions and learn from fellow tech enthusiasts.

# The Site 🖱️

**The Administratum Archives** is a place for me to publicly post both my tech and hobby related musings. There is no schedule, there is no topic, only my keyboard and a worn out spellchecker.

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy your stay. The Emperor protects.
